# ansible-satellite | Satellite 6.12.x Orchestration

### Install and configure Satellite 6.12.x on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.x and 7.x. This collection can also be used to set up Satellite on AWS.

Fundamental steps are based on the process outlined at the [Satellite 6.1 Installation Guide on the Red Hat Customer Portal](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_satellite/6.12/html-single/installing_satellite_server_in_a_connected_network_environment/index).

At the last revision of this document, the current stable version of Satellite is 6.7

Reference [standup.yml](standup.yml), which is the installation playbook, to see an example of how the playbooks may be structured, or take a look at any of the listed playbooks below.

### **ansible-satellite roles:**
_The following roles are called by several playbooks to orchestrate tasks on the Satellite server. Please review the playbooks to see how these come together to work._

1. [satellite-clients](#create-clients-tools-for-register)
1. [satellite-auth](#satellite-authentication-satellite-auth)
1. [satellite-content](#satellite-content-satellite-content)
1. [satellite-install](#satellite-installation-satellite-install)
1. [satellite-maintenance](#satellite-maintenance-tasks-satellite-maintenance)
1. [satellite-route53](#amazon-route53-dns-registration-satellite-route53)
1. [satellite-selfsubscribe](#satellite-self-subscription-satellite-selfsubscribe)
1. [satellite-setup](#satellite-setup-satellite-setup)
1. [satellite-upgrade](#satellite-in-place-upgrade-satellite-upgrade)

### **ansible-satellite playbooks:**
_These playbooks are executed by Ansible Core or Ansible Tower._

1. [ec2_content_hosts_cleanup.yml](#ec2_content_hosts_cleanupyml)
1. [ec2_content_hosts_report.yml](#ec2_content_hosts_reportyml)
1. [customer_portal_api_test.yml](#customer_portal_api_testyml)
1. [maintenance.yml](#maintenanceyml)
1. [refresh_ldap_groups.yml](#refresh_ldap_groupsyml)
1. [refresh_s3_rpms.yml](#refresh_s3_rpmsyml)
1. [self-subscribe.yml](#self-subscribeyml)
1. [standup.yml](#standupyml)
1. [upgrade.yml](#upgradeyml)

### **emergency shell scripts:**
_These scripts are written to aid in refreshing subscriptions on all the hosts, based on the .csv file that is generated by [ec2_content_hosts_report.yml](#ec2_content_hosts_reportyml). These are only for emergencies, when the Satellite server is scheduled to be rebuilt. **These depend on the .csv list of the systems generated by that playbook, so in the case of rebuilding Satellite, run that playbook first to make sure you have that file to reference.** Usage of these scripts assumes that you have access to the SSH keys for your AWS instances, and that they are placed in your ${HOME}/.ssh/ directory._

1. [bash-refresh_subscriptions.sh](#bash-refresh_subscriptionssh)
1. [bash-recreate_subscriptions.sh](#bash-recreate_subscriptionssh)

### Configure Playbook
Copy the inventory.template file and fill it out with information for your infrastructure. Add systems to [nodes] for hosts you want tasks to run on.

or create a current host inventory on */goup_vars/inventorycontent.yml*

```inventorycontext.yml
[satellite]
satellite.example.com

[old_satellite]
satellite.example.com

[puppet_master]
satellite.example.com

[puppet_ca]
satellite.example.com

[6RedHatEnterpriseServer:vars]
activationkey='server,6epel'

[7RedHatEnterpriseServec:vars]
activationkey='workstation,6epel'

[nodes]
node1.example.com activationkey= organization=  
node2.example.com activationkey= organization=
 
[satellite]
satellite.example.com

[old_satellite]
satellite.example.com

#[nodes]
#  host.example.com organization=EXAMPLE activationkey=rhel_activation_key"
```
Use activation keys to register the hosts so make sure your activation keys are set up in satellite before running.

#Running

Enable the satellite settings create_new_host_when_facts_are_uploaded and create_new_host_when_report_is_uploaded to have hosts automatically created after puppet runs. You should also enable a default_location and default_organization in satellite. These settings are all under the puppet tab.

To run on all of your nodes (defined in hosts) make sure you update the activationkey variables (in hosts) and then use.

`ansible-playbook -i inventorycontext.yml satellite-playbook.yaml`

Add `-k` (ssh) or `-K` (sudo) if you need password prompts.

You can also run just the puppet registration tasks with

`ansible-playbook -i inventorycontext.yml satellite-playbook.yaml --tags puppet`

After the tasks complete you should have new unmanaged hosts in satellite. Edit the host and add any configuration you need (host groups, network, puppet). Unfortunately, I could not find a way to automate those steps yet. Your best bet is probably [hammer](https://github.com/theforeman/hammer-cli).

Once the hosts have been moved you may need to reinstall the katello-agent. Do that with `ansible all -i hosts -m yum -a "state=absent name=katello-agent"` and then `ansible all -i hosts -m yum -a "state=present name=katello-agent"`

NOTE: For create a Satellite inventory from de old-satellite in a Satellite migration you need to use:

`ansible-playbook -i inventorycontext.yml create_inventory.yml`

For resubscribe nodes in a new satellite based in your inventory context elments

`ansible-playbook -i inventorycontext.yml satellite_re_subscribe.yml`
